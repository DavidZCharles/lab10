              The framework I chose to use was React. This entire page was made using
              a combincation of React, CSS, JavaScript, and 
              <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel.</a> It will cover 
              the process of building the page including how the framework was installed, 
              how it was designed, and overcoming challenges found.

          <h2>Installation process</h2>
              <p>
                  In order to use React I first had to install Node.js on my computer.
                  I retrieved it from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">official website</a> 
                  to install the latest version. Afterwards, I used VS Code to edit and build
                  my webpage.

          <h2>Building my webpage</h2>
          <p>
              Before even uploading to GitHub, I first worked on the content
              of the website. The following steps are what I did to create 
              my website:
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  I used the following command in the VS Code terminal 
                  to create my React App. It took a couple minutes for 
                  it to load everything, but this generated the necessary 
                  files for my webpage. This also Initialized the app as a
                  git repository.
              </li>
              <pre><code>npx create-react-app lab10</code></pre> 
              <li>
                  After creating the app, I next had to enter the directory.
                  This ensured that the git commands I later use properly work.
                  <pre><code>cd lab10</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Next came the actual webpage development. Once ensuring that the page
                  could be hosted locally, I filled in the content of the page using
                  a JavaScript file. From within the file I also imported a related CSS
                  file to handle the design/format of the webpage.
              </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section className="Connecting and Hosting">
          <h2>Connecting and Hosting my Webpage</h2>
            <p>
                Once I finished building the webpage locally, I then had to connect the 
                React app to my GitHub for hosting. A dedicated repository was created in advance.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First I needed to build the page. This was executed with the following command:
                </li>
                <pre><code>npm run build</code></pre> 
                <li>
                    Next, I had to connect the React app to the dedicated repository.
                    In this way, I pushed all changes I made to the app to the repository.  
                    Since I was adding an existing repository to it, the commands I used
                    these commands:
                    <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/DavidZCharles/lab10.git</code></pre>
                    <pre><code>git branch -M main</code></pre>
                    <pre><code>git push -u origin main</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, I needed to link the project to Vercel to host the webpage. 
                    This was done by simply using the command:
                    <pre><code>vercel</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, all that was left was to deploy the app. Through Vercel, I needed to use
                    the next command to successfully deploy my webpage
                    <pre><code>vercel --prod</code></pre> 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section className="Challenges">
            <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the entire webpage development I only ran into one major issue. This unfortunately
                only happened when I needed to deploy the app, which is the final step to hosting this webpage.
                Whenever I ran the deploy command, it always resulted in the following error:
                <pre><code>Failed to get remote.origin.url (task must either be run 
in a git repository with a configured origin remote or 
must be configured with the "repo" option).</code></pre>
                I turned to many online forums trying to resolve this issue and it took me a couple hours to resolve.
                This is because many steps involved either cloning or reinstalling the node modules entirely. Due to 
                size of the files it took more time to delete and install them than the entire process of building the 
                webpage. It was very frustrating at first since most solutions found to my issue were steps that I already 
                covered and verified numerous times. This involved constant changes to the origin repo url. Eventually, 
                what got my webpage to finally deploy was by doing the following:
